Nowadays, social media platforms adoption is expanding and plays a vital role in individual social interaction. The expansion of social media for political communication has led to a significant growth in the interest of people in research field for developing models that predict the opinion of user on a political topic. The problem is that we are given a tweet of a person X as input, the aim is to build a model which classifies the tweet Y as ‘left-leaning’ or ‘right-leaning’. The platform used here is twitter as it is a popular social networking site and by default each user's tweets are public which makes data mining convenient. We have to predict the political stance of the user from the user's tweet and express whether the tweet has ‘left’ or ‘right’ political alignment. This work is in context with Indian political scenario. We started with data collection in which the users having inclination towards political party, their handles are used and tweets are collected manually using twitter API and stored in CSV file. Data pre-processing is done. Then we tested our dataset on various models out which SVM gave the best accuracy score.
